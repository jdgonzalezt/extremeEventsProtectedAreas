Protected areas are more exposed to extreme weather than unprotected areas across Central America

Abstract

Central America and the Caribbean are regularly battered by megadroughts, heavy rainfall, heatwaves, and hurricanes. While 21st century climate change is expected to increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of these extreme weather events (EWEs), their incidence on regional protected areas remains poorly explored. We examine historical and future projected EWEs across the region and compare trends both within protected areas and across unprotected lands. Results indicate that while EWEs will increase generally across the region, protected areas will be more exposed to climate extremes than unprotected areas. This is particularly true for heat waves, which are projected to disproportionately affect protected areas across all scenarios, and hurricanes, affecting protected areas more severely in carbon-intensive scenarios. Our findings also indicate that protected savannas and dry forests will be heavily impacted by EWEs, particularly heatwaves and droughts. However, protected areas in the Chocó, the Central American corridor of Panama and Costa Rica, and the Guianan lowland moist forests will likely experience relatively lower impacts. Our results highlight the need for climate change adaptation to boost the resilience of protected areas against EWEs. Unless urgent action is taken, significant damage might be inflicted on the unique biodiversity of the region. 
This repository contains data, code and dynamic figures to reproduce the analyses and figures presented in González-Trujillo et al. paper. It has three folders:

METRICS: contains csv files of the metrics used to characterise exposure to Extreme Weather Events across the Caribbean region.

FIGURES: contains a dynamical representation of a set of metrics computed in a yearly basis (long-term series). Exposure values per grid cell are plotted by year and season in GIFs. Please refer to table 1 in the main text for further information on metric's properties and computation.
